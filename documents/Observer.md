</p>



The observer pattern allows "observer" objects to register for and receive updates whenever changes are made to "subject" objects.

This pattern allow us to define "one-to-many" relationships between many observers receiving updates from the same subject.

***When should you use it?***

- Receive changes made on another object
- In MVC, controller observes model changes

***What should you be careful about?***
- Overkill for simple models or properties that never change
- Before using this pattern, define what you expect to change and when
