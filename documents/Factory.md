The Factory pattern let us create objects without exposing its type to callers.
The Factory pattern is widely used in Swift code. Itâ€™s very useful when you need to provide a high level of flexibility for your code.



***Challenges***

- The factory pattern is limited to types that share a common protocol or superclass.
