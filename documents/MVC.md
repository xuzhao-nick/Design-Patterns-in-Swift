The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern separates objects into three types: models, views and controllers.

<b>Views</b> display visual elements and controls on screen. They are usually subclasses of `UIView`.

**Controllers**  coordinate between models and views. Thet are usually subclasses of `UIViewContrller`,
